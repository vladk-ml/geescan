# Improvement Suggestions

## Database Schema and Initialization (12/30/2024)

### Database Schema Reset
- Current schema needs to be updated to include timestamp defaults
- When reinitializing the database:
  1. Add default timestamps (created_at, updated_at) in the initial schema
  2. Remove the need for migration files by having a complete schema
  3. Consider adding indexes for common query patterns

### AOI Ordering
- Current implementation has ORDER BY created_at DESC in get_aois
- Options to consider:
  1. Remove ordering to use natural database order (by ID)
  2. Keep chronological order but document this behavior
  3. Make ordering configurable via query parameter
  4. Add proper indexes if we keep date-based ordering

### Future Considerations
- Document the chosen ordering strategy in API documentation
- Consider adding pagination if the list of AOIs grows large
- May want to add additional indexes based on common query patterns
