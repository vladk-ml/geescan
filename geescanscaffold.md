## Task: Reliable AOI Configuration and Management for GEE SAR Data Monitoring

**Objective:** Develop a robust and efficient system within the existing application for users to define, configure, save, and manage Areas of Interest (AOIs) specifically for monitoring SAR data from Google Earth Engine (GEE). The system should automatically detect new SAR images within saved AOIs, trigger data processing and export to Google Drive.

**I. Full Stack Architecture**

This architecture uses a microservices approach, which provides flexibility, scalability, and maintainability.

4. **AOI Service:**
   * **Purpose:** Manages AOI definitions, storage, and retrieval
   * **Framework:** Flask (or your chosen backend framework)
   * **Database:** PostgreSQL with PostGIS (or another database)
   * **Libraries:**
     * `Flask-RESTful` or `Flask-RESTX`
     * `SQLAlchemy` or another ORM
     * `GeoAlchemy2` for spatial database operations with PostGIS

5. **GEE Processor Service:**
   * **Purpose:** Handles interactions with the Google Earth Engine API for data processing and export
   * **Framework:** Flask (or your chosen backend framework)
   * **Libraries:**
     * `ee` (Earth Engine Python API)
     * `Flask-RESTful` or `Flask-RESTX`
     * `google-cloud-storage` (if needed) for interacting with Google Cloud Storage

6. **Monitoring Service:**
   * **Purpose:** Periodically checks for new SAR images within saved AOIs and triggers notifications or data export
   * **Framework:** Flask (or your chosen backend framework)
   * **Libraries:**
     * `ee` (Earth Engine Python API)
     * `APScheduler` or `Celery` for scheduling tasks
   * **Notifications:**
     * `smtplib` for sending email notifications
     * A library for sending push notifications or using WebSockets (e.g., `socket.io`)

7. **Database:**
   * **Choice:** PostgreSQL with PostGIS
     * **Rationale:** Excellent for spatial data, robust, and widely used
   * **Alternative:** MongoDB
     * **Rationale:** Good for flexible schemas and JSON-like data, but might not be as efficient for complex spatial queries
   * **Alternative:** Cloud-based databases (e.g., Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner, DynamoDB)
     * **Rationale:** Easier to manage and scale than self-hosted databases, but can be more expensive

8. **Google Earth Engine:**
   * **API:** `ee` (Earth Engine Python API)
   * **Usage:** Used in the GEE Processor and Monitoring services for:
     * Authenticating with GEE
     * Accessing SAR datasets (e.g., Sentinel-1)
     * Filtering image collections by date, bounds (AOIs), and other criteria
     * Performing server-side processing (e.g., orthorectification, analysis)
     * Exporting data to Google Drive using `ee.batch.Export.image.toDrive()`

9. **Google Drive API:**
   * **Purpose:** Used by the GEE Processor service for authentication and authorization when exporting data to Google Drive
   * **Library:** `google-api-python-client`

**III. Deployment**

* **Containerization:** Docker (for packaging services and their dependencies)
* **Orchestration:**
  * Kubernetes (for deploying and managing containers in a production environment)
  * Docker Compose (for local development and testing)
* **Cloud Platform:**
  * Google Cloud Platform (GCP): GKE (Kubernetes), Cloud Run (serverless), Cloud Functions (serverless), Cloud SQL (database)
  * Amazon Web Services (AWS): EKS (Kubernetes), ECS (containers), Lambda (serverless), RDS (database)
  * Microsoft Azure: AKS (Kubernetes), Azure Container Instances, Azure Functions (serverless), Azure SQL Database
* **Serverless (Alternative):** You could deploy some services (e.g., GEE Processor, Monitoring Service) as serverless functions (Cloud Functions, Lambda, Azure Functions) to reduce operational overhead

**IV. Workflow**

1. **User Authentication:**
   * The user authenticates through the frontend using their Google Account (OAuth 2.0)
   * The User Service generates a JWT that is used for subsequent API requests

2. **AOI Creation:**
   * The user draws an AOI on the map using `leaflet-draw` or uploads a GeoJSON file
   * The frontend sends the AOI geometry, name, dataset, date range, and other parameters to the AOI Service
   * The AOI Service validates the data and stores it in the database

3. **AOI Management:**
   * The frontend retrieves the list of saved AOIs from the AOI Service
   * The user can view, edit, or delete AOIs through the frontend, which sends corresponding requests to the AOI Service

4. **New Image Monitoring:**
   * The Monitoring Service periodically queries GEE using `ee.ImageCollection` to check for new SAR images within saved AOIs
   * The Monitoring Service might use a task queue (e.g., `Celery`) or a scheduler (e.g., `APScheduler`) to manage the monitoring tasks

5. **Data Processing and Export:**
   * When new images are detected, the Monitoring Service or the user (via the frontend) triggers the GEE Processor Service to process and export the data
   * The GEE Processor Service uses the `ee` API to perform necessary computations on the SAR data (e.g., orthorectification, analysis)
   * The GEE Processor Service uses `ee.batch.Export.image.toDrive()` and the Google Drive API to export the data to the user's Google Drive

6. **Notifications:**
   * The Monitoring Service sends notifications to the user when new images are detected or when exports are complete
   * Notifications can be sent via email, push notifications, or WebSockets
